Other times when the task is more complex, writing your own code to do it can get overwhelming pretty quickly.\n","\n","Luckily one of the great benefits of the Python language is that it has a very active open-source community, which means tons of great libraries and frameworks we can use to do the heavy lifting. One of the main reasons that Python is such a great choice for data science is that the scientific community has written plenty of great packages for various advanced purposes. This means that when we use Python, we have access to a wealth of robust, effective tools written and maintained by an army of volunteers and professionals."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Pandas\n","\n","![pandas logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Pandas_logo.svg/2880px-Pandas_logo.svg.png)\n","\n","The pandas library will likely be your most-used library over the course of this program.
